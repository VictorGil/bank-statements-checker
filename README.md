# bank-statements-checker
Java app to check the statements in your bank account.

My mom credit card was cloned and after reporting it to the bank, I was supposed to go through dozens of statements trying to match them, in order to be sure that the bank had returned all the money... So I decided to create this small app which checks the statements (which were previously exported to a csv file) and do some basic calculations.
